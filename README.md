# Verse Snippets
A collection of verse snippets I made to use in UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite). 

All snippets are licensed under the MIT license. Please refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/mephistia/verse-snippets/blob/main/LICENSE) file for details.
- in short, you may use them for anything you want, if you keep the license text along the code.
